R package for Sublime Text 3
------------

It is a next generation of [Enhanced-R](https://github.com/randy3k/Enhanced-R). I have refactored the
original code and the old settings are not compatible with the current setup,
so I opened a new repo for it.

Features:

  1. Multi platform support (windows/mac/linux)
  2. Send commands to various applicaionts (R gui, Terminal, iTerm 2, screen, tmux...)
  3. Function hints in status bar
  4. Autocompletions for base R commands
  5. Support Roxygen, Rcpp, R Sweave and R Markdown syntaxes. 
  6. [knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr) build command for R markdown and Rnw files.

This package contains an extended version of the R syntax
definition, so you can safely disable the default `R` package.
If you are only interested in the syntax files, check [R-Extended](https://github.com/randy3k/R-Extended).
